# Laser powder bed fusion layer segmentation

This project was made in Alkimat during a computer vision master's course on UFSC (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina).

The scope of the development was to segment a printed layer on an image shoot from a Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) machine developed in Alkimat.

This could help to monitor and identify problems on real time during metal 3D printing.

To run the project you must clone this repository and install requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you should have installed an environment to run Jupyter notebooks. This is the best way to watch the image segmentation results.

If not, you can just execute part-segmentation.py. In this route, images are generated and stored in subfolders to analyze the results.
